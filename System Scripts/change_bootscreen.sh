# This script is made with the purpose of changing the boot screen in ubuntu, lucid lynx.
#The plymouth theme uses a theme framework to display the background and animation, so you wonâ€™t be able to take a simple wallpaper and put it on the boot screen. The Ubuntu repository comes with several plymouth themes that you can install in your system.
